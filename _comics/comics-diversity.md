## About this comic

Tackling the issue of **LGBT rights** from a child's perspective is always a challenge, not precisely from the angle of kids themselves but because of how the rest of people will interpret it. So here I wanted to play with the symbolism of colors, as if _"what is on a color anyway?"_ â€” to bring the point that deep down we are all alike and deserve the same rights and opportunities in life.
