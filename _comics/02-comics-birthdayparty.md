description: A story concept featuring my characters that I developed for Kid's Comics Unite intensive workshop as a participant in 2022. I plan to further refine this story plan during 2024 in order to build a better pitch for publishers.

## About this comic

Tackling the issue of **LGBT rights** from a child's perspective is always a challenge, not precisely from the angle of kids themselves but because of how the rest of people will interpret it. So here I wanted to play with the symbolism of colors, as if _"what is on a color anyway?"_ â€” to bring the point that deep down we are all alike and deserve the same rights and opportunities in life.
