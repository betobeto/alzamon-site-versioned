description: A 4-page comic pilot I created featuring my kid characters Daniel, Elias and Susana. I want to believe I have evolved in both drawing and plot making since then.

## About this comic

Daniel and Elias are original characters I designed back in the 90s â€” so this has been a long time coming. One of my persistent goals is to create an ongoing comic or graphic novel series with them and this has been so far the closest I've gotten to it. I still think this came up fine as a result.
