## About this comic

On early 2016 I attended the [European comics festival at Angoulême, France](https://www.bdangouleme.com/) — a longtime dream of mine. Because barely any other Costa Rican has even been there, I thought about making a 4-page comic using my characters showing facts about Costa Rica in French as a giveaway. About 50 copies were printed. I also learned that in regards of being considered by European publishing houses, the bar had to be set much higher than this... but that is another story.
