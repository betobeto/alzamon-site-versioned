### The feelings of trying times

The year 2020 will be known onwards as the year of **[the Coronavirus pandemic](/2020/05/16/dealing-with-pandemic-times)**, which turned the world's politics and economy upside down in the blink of the eye, maybe forever. As of this writing the world still awaits for a miraculous vaccine to end the virus' power and the mandatory social distancing and shelter-in-place orders that have cost millions of jobs and life losses around the world.

As a way to cope with this distressing reality, I created and published this illustration on my Instagram account. The message being that nevermind how tough these times are being for all of us, this will also come to pass. Nothing stays forever; the good things, the bad things and everything in between. What is important is what are we doing in the present with the time and health we have.
