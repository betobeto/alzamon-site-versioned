### A Life in Three (so far) Characters

Some of us artists end up over time designing cartoon characters that eventually become our artistic alter egos, our *"paper kids"* if it fits better. These are mine.

**Daniel** is the oldest of them all. I began drawing him circa 1995 when I was still at the University of Costa Rica. The Lord Fauntleroy-esque hairstyle, the odd red sports suit â€” it all came together almost instantly. I picture him as a 9-year old wisecracking, street smart, outgoing yet well-meaning boy who acts first and thinks second way too many times, which usually gets him into trouble.

**Elias** is Daniel's best friend, a year his junior, maybe because he's the yin to Daniel's yang. Elias is your typical nerdy boy too sage for his years, an introvert, almost zen-like type who has an elaborate answer for everything. Everything that isn't what Daniel excels at, that is.

**Susana** is the latest newcomer to the gang. She can be as temperamental as Daniel so they clash more often that they would admit. However she's got a soft spot for fair causes like ecology, global warming, animal rights and equal fairness for all. She lives with an older sister from who she's taken a lot of personality cues.

One of my perennial dreams has been to create an ongoing comic or graphic novel series with them. I did one briefly in 2011 but has been put on hold, with exception of two episodes available on the [Comics section](/comics/) of this site.
