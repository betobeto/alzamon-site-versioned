work_details:
    - Digital artwork, 2020
    - I originally drew this for a 2020 New Year celebration motif. Once 2020 turned into The Worst Year Ever In History <em>(except for the launch of this site, of course)</em>, I couldn't stand to see this on <a href="/assets/images/portfolio/2020_i_happyNewYear@1500w.jpg" target="_blank">its original form</a> anymore so I removed all the 2020 references.
