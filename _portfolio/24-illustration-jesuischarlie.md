### Background story on the illustration

In January 2015 the world was shocked at the French satiric magazine [Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting), killing most of their cartoonists on staff. Being a straight attack to freedom of expression, many cartoonists around the world reacted shockingly and artistically. 

Some years before I had visited Belgium and got captivated with both the country and the work of surrealistic Belgian painter [Ren√© Magritte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte). The idea of parodying Magritte's [*The Key Of Dreams*](https://alexanderstorey.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/artwork-analysis-the-key-to-dreams-by-magritte/) came quickly. Soon thereafter I was told the Belgian comics magazine **Spirou**, where many of my favorite artists have been published, was accepting submissions for a special commemorative number. I sent my parody in and some weeks later I got a copy of the magazine in the mail. And for sure it was published (I still was signing as **Obert** back then). Being Belgians, they were probably touched by the Magritte nod. It still remains one of the highlights of my illustration career.
