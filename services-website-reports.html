                These days, setting yourself up an online presence is rather easy - you don’t even have to know code to
                get
                by. However, just being there is not enough. You are but a lost needle in a gigantic haystack where the
                biggest and loudest seem to be the winners… or are they?
                Ask yourself:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Am I reaching my career/business goals?</li>
                <li>Are clients/art directors/editors able to find you on Google?</li>
                <li>Does your website's image correspond with that of your professional self?</li>
                <li>Is your website's navigation intuitive enough to go anywhere on your site?</li>
                <li>Is your content easily reachable, optimized and serviceable?</li>
                <li>Is your website responsive (optimized for small screens)?</li>
                <li>Are you prioritizing the right subjects for you in your online presence?</li>
            </ul>



            <p>If you have already set up your stake on the web but are not seeing the results you want, I can help you
                address these issues. My goal is to deliver you a <strong>solid, useful investment</strong> that will pay back itself many times in the long run.</p>

                <li>Your current strengths and weaknesses</li>
                <li>Your social media integration</li>
