description: We left ourselves being told art is worthless as a career. But this wasn't the way it used to be. Nor it should continue to â€” if we care to do something about it.

Eons ago, I majored from Graphic Arts and Design at the [University of Costa Rica](https://ucr.ac.cr/). Long before that, I dreamed of building a career as an animation artist â€” back when that meant 2D drawing and not 3D CGI. However, the Internet started pulling me in other directions mid-careeer, which set me the course as an **UX/Front End developer** to this day.

I confess my initial plan was to give this web thing a try for 2-3 years to make some money and then get back to my artistic swing, only to find out that I wasn't going to make on this *"swing"* of mine as much money or find jobs as easily as with IT. In fact upon this realization I quit drawing for a number of years â€” something I now regret deeply.

There was an underlying, fearful reasoning to it all: The constant menace of becoming yet another *"starving artist"*. I don't come from a family with artistic backgrounds. Both my parents were typical office workers. Despite falling in grace of a very generous and encouraging Arts teacher in high school, I had no artistic relatives to look forward to. However, my parents never questioned me about my choice of an artistic career in college â€” although they probably were somewhat worried about my financial future.

### The cheapening of the artist career

Pre-1980s, [pre-computers in design](https://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-design/The-digital-revolution), artists really had to show their chops in order not only to have a career, but to keep themselves in business. Not much of a chance to cheat with analog tools. Either you really knew what you were doing, or you didn't.

The introduction of the [Macintosh Computer](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_128k.html) changed the graphic design game upside down. Tasks that were either tedious or highly complex with analog techniques now were becoming a point-and-click affair. Desktop publishing was born, the techniques once expensive and exclusive to giant publishing houses now became cheap and available to the unwashed masses. And gradually, the knowledge (and earnings) of the chosen few who mastered the art of analog compositing began to become irrelevant, as computers seemingly were capable of doing it all now.

Somewhere along this way, the idea among laymen that design, and consequently everything related to it (painting, drawing, etc) became an easy, push-button affair began to take shape in the general culture, thus changing the perception of the arts as something easy and cheap to do, therefore something of little value as a career â€” unlike becoming a doctor, or any of the so-called [STEM careers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) every finance-conscious parent wants their kids to get into.

### Were things really better before?

Let's take [Kelly Freas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Freas) for an example. Mr. Freas's heyday as a highly recognized, on-demand illustrator was in the 1950s through the 1980s. Hundreds of covers for MAD Magazine and other science fiction publications, advertisements (illustration was still a highly demanded resource for advertising), even Queen's [News of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_of_the_World_(album)) album cover... the man did it all and then some. And sure enough he commanded not just a living wage, but a very good one enough to sustain their family on a single income.

Need more? Take [Al Capp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Capp) and other cartoonists from the 1920s and 1930s. Before TV and the Internet, newspaper comics were the most accessible form of visual entertainment, and their top artists (even most second-rate others) were commanding huge wages that could be translated to [millions of dollars today](https://www.printmag.com/featured/the-advertising-power-of-comic-book-artists/). They were truly the entertainment kings of their era.

Then technology came and inverted the wealth equation, forever. Was it unavoidable? What's the scenario now?

Technically wise, it has never been easier or cheaper to learn the ropes of artistic creation. There are [tons of online courses](https://www.domestika.org/) you can take, at a fraction of the price of an old arts conservatory, and from the comfort of their old home. Resources for artistic creations are aplenty. Therefore, the former Olympus of a selected few became flooded with millions of talented creatives fighting for recognition and a place in library shelves, Netflix or the big screen. And you know what happens what that happens, right?

It's nothing but a new twist on the market's **supply and demand** law. Scarcity creates value, and the opposite (abundance lowering market value) is also true. 

And if on top of all this artists never care to learn about the ways of money, it's a recipe ripe for disaster.


### You can spend years at art college and never hear a thing about financial management.

No wonder artists can't tell why they are always getting the short end of the stick. They end up selling their hard-earned art skills for peanuts because frankly **they don't know better.** And media moguls use this lack of knowledge to their advantage, every time. Artists get being constantly used, abused and exploited by the market and somehow we've ended up normalizing what shouldn't be normal by any standards.

Illustrator Lily Williams recently published a tremendous blog post named ["Artists You Need to Charge More"](https://lilywilliamsart.com/2021/11/15/artists-income-inflation/) which in turn inspired me to write this one. Lily has gone into the subject far deeper than I could even aspire to and therefore it is a highly recommended read. An eye-opener. But just in case you don't feel like reading another post, here are its main takeaways.

- **Just because you enjoy making art doesn't mean you don't deserve money for it.** Long story short: the only way to become the best you can be at your craft is to make it into a *sustainable* career, so you can dedicate to it the amount of time needed to perfect your skills. Time you would otherwise have to split into multiple jobs to survive. With age, you begin to realize time is a more scarce asset than money so you don't want it to go to waste. Easy to do? Not at all. Hey, illustration for me is still a side gig and IT jobs are still my bread and butter. But this is why I'm building the foundations to make a transition that works for me and hopefully gives me a fair retribution for my art work.

- **Art isn't any easier to master than any other career.** Don't let anyone else kid you otherwise. Here I quote Ms. Williams directly:
  
> Art is not only valuable to society, as history has shown, but a practice that takes time, education, and knowledge.
