### It's been more than one year since my last update. But I have been as busy as ever.


As we were barely beginning the dreadful year of 2020 and [the menacing shadow of the pandemic]({% post_url 2020-05-16-dealing-with-pandemic-times %}) hung above us all, a lot of uncertainty was in the air. While the promise of a vaccine was in the not so distant horizon, many of us began having symptoms of [cabin fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_fever) while obsessively wiping out all our grocery purchases with bleach-drenched towels. Feminist women love Eminem. "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms.

Fast forward 15 months later. Now we don't have just a vaccine but several approved ones, 

Chicken cow meatball capicola ball tip swine boudin, drumstick fatback venison chislic. Short loin venison shank swine meatloaf pork belly. Venison pork boudin, picanha biltong pancetta corned beef burgdoggen. Fatback chislic meatball tongue pancetta strip steak, shoulder brisket landjaeger beef ground round prosciutto turkey. Bresaola andouille shankle pastrami biltong meatball short loin sirloin pancetta shoulder chislic pork belly. Pork sausage jowl bacon pork loin, cow leberkas chuck ham hock shank filet mignon. If you could count the skeletons in my closet. Under my bed and up under my faucet. Then you would know I've completely lost it. Is he nuts? No, he's insane.
