description: Non-fungible tokens are the latest craze among digital art collectors. Detractors say it is ruining the planet. Where do I stand with this?

I can already hear most of you groan from here. *"Oh no, there goes another chap pretending to explain me about that dang NFT crypto scam business. I ain't having any of it! It is ruining the planet! Go away"*

Tell you what... I took recently an online course on cryptocurrency babble and all that precisely because I was feeling lost in all the buzz around it and ‚Äî well, I don't like feeling lost in the cutting edge of things so I end up writing posts like these to try fix that. There's a reason why I ended up being a designer/artist and not a Wall Street trade wolf.

However, the smart-minded can get the gist of it fairly quickly: Criptocurrencies, or *digital assets* that are usually exchangable for goods and services on the Internet just like money, are gaining momentum and interest not just among geeks but along the mainstream.

### Slow it brainy, give me the basics

Let's get to the basics first: When we talk about *cryptocurrency* and about *tokens*, we are mostly talking about the same thing ‚Äî a digital asset whose proof of existance and value is registered on that asset's blockchain (think of it as a giant ledger) which automatically registers the movements, ownerships and exchanges of such asset in a certified, digitally verified, can't-be-tampered-with fashion. That's the most un-nerdy explaination I can come up with.

In fact the physical coins and bills we grew up with and are used to handle are not valuable items out of themselves, but constitute a *representation* of the value they claim to carry. Truth is, the global economy works in a consensus setting about the general value (or lack thereof) of things, mostly set up by the old supply and demand laws of the market. The more demand an asset has and is on short supply, the more expensive (valuable) it becomes. Conversely, more supply and less demand cheapens the price/value of said asset. That's Economics 101 for you.

### So, about that NFT thing

Hoping we've got the concept of **tokens** down pat, it's time to talk about *fungibility*: No, it has nothing to do with [the Smurfs' houses](http://bluebuddies.com/Smurfs_Smurf_Sheets_&_Bedding-10.htm) or an exotic pizza ingredient. In crypto-babble, fungibility is all about an asset being able to be exchanged by another asset, not only as in money but also as registered assets in a given currency's blockchain. For example, if I have a wallet with enough [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) assets to buy a [Criptokitty](https://decrypt.co/resources/cryptokitties) with it, I am thus *"buying"* a Criptokitty with my Ethereum.
Or am I?

It just happens that Cryptokitties were the first foray into a then unheard-of concept: create *value through scarcity* in a digital context. Which goes against our prevalent idea of digital through the Internet, where everything can be (and usually is) copied, reproduced and copied again *ad nauseam* with no end in sight. And remember that bit about supply and demand above? Yes, that's why the percieved value of digital assets on the Internet (images, music, software, what have you) nears zero. You may have spent hours or even weeks crafting out an illustration or music piece, but the final asset embodying such work ‚Äîthe JPG/PNG file or the MP3 file, or the blog post or tweet or Instagram post housing it) has no intrinsic value whatsoever.

**NFT** is short for *non-fungible tokens*, or digital assets that unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and most every cryptocurrency out there, cannot be replaced by another similar asset in their blockchain as the information recorded in this asset's smart contract makes it unique, unalterable and indivisible. There are no two NFTs alike in the world. This is what crypto whales and well-off speculators are pouring millions into.

Back in March 2021, a digital collage artwork by pop artist Beeple was sold by its Ethereum equivalent of [a whopping 69 million dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/arts/beeple-nft-buyer-ether.html) ‚Äî this bold move by auction house Christie's is what, in all evidence, skyrocketed the NFT buzz and craze to these days. It has become the new Gold Rush among techno-aware artists.

### But this thing kills trees, doesn't it?

If you could count the skeletons in my closet. Under my bed and up under my faucet. Then you would know I've completely lost it. Is he nuts? No, he's insane.
